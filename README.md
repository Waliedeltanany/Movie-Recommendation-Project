🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System

An AI-powered desktop application that recommends similar movies or TV shows based on user input. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify content similarity from the Netflix dataset, and displays movie posters fetched from the TMDb or OMDB APIs — all inside a polished Tkinter GUI.
